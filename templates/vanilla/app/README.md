This project was bootstrapped with [Create Pact App](https://github.com/kadena-io/create-pact-app).

## Getting Started


Open the `index.js` file in your browser

**NOTE: if you selected `deploy-own` option please follow the instructions in the `pact` directory README to deploy your own contract and start interacting with it as it will show errors until app finds your contract instance deployed on-chain**
